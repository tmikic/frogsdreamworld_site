      <hr class="w-75" style="border-top-color: white;">
      <p>This server obviously has a community surrounding it but it's not as big as you think.
      the server might have 117000+ members but as noted on the main page it's an emote server.
      A lot of people join an emote server for the emotes (obviously) but this also means they ignore it
      after joining it, often muting it. Well that's a loss for them because this server has a fun community
      to talk with. There's a bunch of active people to talk to every day, a lot of the active members are good friends.
      and you can be also one of them!</p>
      <p>Talk in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <span class="font-weight-bold">stream</span> chat to talk with others about the stream when our streamy boy is active on twitch!</li>
        <li>The <span class="font-weight-bold">Kool Kids Klub</span> to talk with other people that are active enough to have earned a special Kool Kids role!</li>
        <li>General with the other members, the staff team and sometimes even the owner himself! </li>
        <li>The memes channel to use the amazing Dank Meme bot and laugh as you browse through the most trending memes at that time.</li>
        <li>The art channel to share or look at amazing art being created by the members of the server! There's some really great ones. </li>
        <li>The dutch channel to talk with dutch people, but be careful! Only the dutch language is allowed to be spoken there!</li>
        <li>The dutch channel to talk with dutch people, but be careful! Only the dutch language is allowed to be spoken there!</li>
        <li>Counting to count to the highest number with other people.</li>
        <li>Bot Spam to spam all of the amazing features the bots have and earn credits!</li>
        <li>Spam to spam all of the available emotes, spam funny copy pastes and more!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And don't forget to peak in funny moments to see what the admins thought were the funniest moments in the server & to peek in the shop channel to see which roles are available to buy for only 1000 pepo's!</p>
      <p>The community certainly is a blast to be apart of and as a active member myself I do recommend becoming part of it! Hope to talk to you there!</p>
