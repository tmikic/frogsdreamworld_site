Community

- This server obviously has a community surrounding it but it's not as big as you think.
the server might have 117000+ members but as noted on the main page it's an emote server.
A lot of people join an emote server for the emotes (obviously) but this also means they ignore it
after joining it, often muting it. Well that's a loss for them because this server has a fun community
to talk with. There's a bunch of active people to talk to every day, a lot of the active members are good friends
and you can be also one of them!

Talk in general with the other members, the staff team and sometimes even the owner himself!
Go to the memes channel to use the amazing Dank Meme bot and laugh as you browse through the most trending memes at that time.
Go to the art channel to share or look at amazing art being created by the members of the server! There's some really great ones.
The community certainly is a blast to be apart of and as a active member myself I do recommend becoming part of it! Hope to talk to you there!
